# Data

This folder stores all of the logged IMU data, with each person's data being stored in a subfolder.

test-data contains log values used for testing that the logging and normalising scripts work, *not* actual exercise data.

This folder is considered the 'root' folder by the scripts `.log-data` and `.normalise-data`.
