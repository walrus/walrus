\subsection{Motivation}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%




In the West, obesity is a growing problem - as of 2015, \textbf{62.9\%} of adults in the UK were either overweight or obese, a number which is still increasing.\cite{inref1}

While many people express a desire to exercise more this does not always translate into action, and one of the reasons for this is that
people often don't know how to exercise, and even if they do exercise this lack of knowledge stops or hampers them from exercising as effectively as they might be able to.

Traditionally the solution to this dilemma has been provided by people like coaches, instructors and personal trainers. They generally bring a lot of expertise and experience, and are highly effective, but the cost of hiring them can be unaffordable for many people.

With advances in technology, more and more of the tasks which personal trainers and their ilk were relied upon to do can instead be performed by machines. Companies are starting to release gadgets which can classify different exercises, normally into large groups such as 'walking' or 'cycling', but as yet they do not tell the user how well they are performing said exercise.

\section{Background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Neural Networks}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Neural networks are currently the focus of a lot of research in academia, and also the focus of a lot of commercial work to realise their potential - virtually all of the major tech companies make use of the technology, or are experimenting with it.

Because my project is centered around a novel usage of existing neural network techniques, rather than any new techniques, my research into the theory of neural networks has been relatively limited, and I have focussed on their application to my project.

Most of my general knowledge of Neural Networks comes from the third year DoC course \textbf{395 Machine Learning}\cite{bgref0}. (in particular, see the notes for the Artificial Neural Networks lectures):

As well as the course notes, the lecturers have recommended several other resources (a list of which can be found on the previously linked page), of which the paper \textit{Artifical Neural Networks: A Tutorial}\cite{bgref1} is the most relevant. This provided an overall introduction to neural networks and gave a different perspective to that given by the DoC course.

Another useful reference has been \textit{Neural Networks - Algorithms and Applications}\cite{bgref2}. This contains lots of practical information of direct relevance to the implementation of neural networks.

\subsection{ArduinoANN}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

My neural network implementation is based on \textit{ArduinoANN}\cite{bgref3}, a C implementation of a two layer feed-forward backpropogation network. 

ArduinoANN itself draws heavily on \textit{John Bullinaria's Step by Step Guide to Implementing a Neural Network in C}\cite{bgref4}.

\subsection{Embedded Systems \& The Intel Curie}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Embedded Systems}

While most machine learning has historically done on relatively powerful desktop systems or specialised hardware, modern embedded systems are often more powerful than the desktop computers available when techniques such as back propagation were developed.\cite{bgref5}. 

As embedded systems become more powerful and more widespread, machine learning programs will be run on them much more often.

\subsubsection{The Intel Curie}

The Intel Curie is a System-On-a-Chip (SOC) with an integrated six-axis accelerometer/gyroscope and an integrated 128-neuron neural network that operates on the data from the sensors.

Despite the presence of the neural network, which Intel call the \textit{Curie Pattern Matching Engine}\cite{bgref6}, I will be implementing a separate neural network. This decision is explained in another section. \todo[inline]{link when written}

The module is currently available on an Arduino 101 board (known as the Genuino 101 outside the US), or an Intel Quark microcontroller - I will be developing using the Arduino board.

The Arduino/Genuino 101 provides a set of I/O pins, power supply, and Bluetooth connectivity for the on-board Curie module.

More information can be found at Intel's homepage for the Curie\cite{bgref6}.

Information on software dependencies can be found here. \todo[inline]{link when done}

\subsection{Bluetooth / Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Bluetooth Low Energy\cite{bgref7} is a low power version of the Bluetooth standard designed to allow devices to transfer small amounts of data in an energy efficient manner. The standard debuted in 2011, and is now widely supported by Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices.

\subsection{Fitness Trackers}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There are a wide variety of fitness trackers available on the market - most utilise a combination of gyroscopes, accelerometers and GPS, and more sometimes heart rate monitors, altimeters and other sensors to track the user's movements and provide feedback.

Tracking via sensors other than those available on the Intel Curie (I.E. gyroscope and accelerometer) is outside the scope of this project, so I will be ignoring this functionality in other fitness trackers.

Of these, the majority simply measure the input data and do simple analysis to provide basic data, E.G. heart rate or calories burned, but a growing number use various forms of machine learning to do more in depth analysis. 

\subsubsection{Fitbit}

Fitbit is one of the leading brands in wearables and fitness tracking. In particular, their \textit{SmartTrack}\cite{bgref8} technology aims to automatically recognise which activity the wearer is currently doing, and currently supports seven different activities.

\subsubsection{Google}

Google has a line of wearables called \textit{Android Wear}\cite{bgref9}, which make use of their \textit{Google Fit}\cite{bgref10} software (also compatible with other wearables).
Google Fit automatically detects walking, running and cycling.

\subsubsection{Optimize Fitness}

Optimize Fitness\cite{bgref11} is an iOS application that claims to use 'Powerful machine learning algorithms' to 'analyze your preferences, workout history, and goals to deliver efficient workouts that keep you improving wherever and whenever you exercise.'

\subsubsection{Boltt}

Boltt\cite{bgref12} is a startup that aims to use multiple sensors (embedded in shoes and on a wristband) along with AI to give guidance. Currently it is in the pre-order stage.

\subsubsection{Actofit}

Actofit\cite{bgref13} is another startup that recently funded via Indiegogo\cite{bgref14}. They claim to 'identify 75+ exercises, count reps, evaluate form, measure heart rate, calories burned and more' using a wristband.

\subsubsection{FocusMotion}

FocusMotion\cite{bgref15} provides an SDK that works on many different devices, and uses their sensors as input to their machine learning algorithms, which aim to classify and analyse user's movements.

\subsection{Bodyweight Exercises}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While there is no objective standard for how most exercises should be performed, for the most common exercises there exists a broad consensus on the proper technique.

I will use these as a baseline to compare a user's movements to, and to ensure that when recording training data the examples are correct. I have used the following guides as my references.

\subsubsection{Press Ups}

The generally agreed proper technique for a press up is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Place your hands on the ground slightly more than shoulder width apart, and your feet behind you. Your body should be straight, with no sagging at the hips. You should be looking slightly ahead, not vertically downwards, and your arms should be locked out.
    \item Keeping your body straight, lower yourself down until your elbows are at a 90° angle to the floor, and upper arms are horizontal. Your elbows should remain close in to the side of your body, not splayed out to the sides.
    \item In the same manner, raise yourself back up with your arms until they lock out again.
\end{itemize}

I have used the following two articles as my reference for good technique when doing a press up:

Nerd Fitness' article \textit{How to do a Proper Push Up}\cite{bgref16}
is a good overall guide to technique, while Breaking Muscle's article \textit{Pimp Your Push Up: 3 Common Mistakes And 5 Challenging Variations}\cite{bgref17} addresses a few common issues with people's technique.

A video illustrating these points can be found on Youtube.\cite{bgref18}

\subsubsection{Sit Ups}

Opinions on proper sit up technique vary, primarily over the placement of the arms - some guides recommend crossing them over your chest, while others recommend placing your hands on the back of your head. 

LiveStrong.com\cite{bgref19} recommends placing hands behind the head, while military.com\cite{bgref20}recommends crossing your arms over your chest. 

The general opinion seems to be that either is acceptable, with the hands-behind-the-head technique considered slightly harder\cite{bgref21}.

Keeping your hands loose is generally considered a bad thing as it allows you to use them to lift your torso, rather than your abdominal muscles. 

For my reference, I will use the crossed arms technique because placing your arms behind your head encourages you to pull yourself up from the neck, rather than the waist, which the crossed arms technique avoids.

There is also not a consensus on whether it is better to anchor your feet during a sit up. For the purposes of my reference, I will be recommending unanchored feet. 

For more specific information on unanchored sit ups, the article \textit{How to Do Sit-Ups Without Anchoring Your Feet}\cite{bgref22}
The proper technique for a sit up, with the caveats above, is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lie flat on your back, with your knees bent at a 90° angle and feet on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest and straighten your neck. and spine.
    \item Keeping your legs immobile, lift your back off the floor by flexing at the waist, and continue until your back is vertical. This should be a smooth, controlled movement not a jerk, and should not be assisted by the arms. Your neck should remain straight, but the spine can flex a little. You may find it helpful to exhale as you do this.
    \item Having reached the upright position, rest if necessary and lower yourself back down in the same manner. You may find it helpful to inhale as you do this.
\end{itemize}

This video\cite{bgref23} gives a good demonstration of good sit up technique, although it uses the hands behind the head technique.

\subsubsection{Lunges}

Opinions on proper lunge technique are fairly settled, with a strong consensus. While there are many possible varieties of lunges, including those with weights, I will concentrate on lunges using bodyweight alone.

My main source for technique was Shape.com\cite{bgref24}.

My baseline reference for good lunge technique is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stand up straight, with shoulders relaxed and core engaged
    \item Step forwards with one leg, and lower your body until the forward knees is bent at 90° to the floor. The back knee should not touch the floor, and your upper body should remain upright.
    \item In the same manner, smoothly push back up to your starting position.
\end{itemize}

This video\cite{bgref25} illustrates good lunge technique.

\section{Design \& Specification}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\todo[inline]{Overall design. Note different versions, and throughout note differences due to different versions. This is basically a specification}

\subsection{Hardware}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\todo[inline]{Overview of hardware used and specifications for alternative}

\subsubsection{Microcontroller}

The requirements of the microcontroller for this project are as follows:

\todo[inline]{finish}

\begin{description}
\item[Processor] The microcontroller's processor needs to be capable of performing a classification
\item[Memory]
\item[Storage]
\item[Accelerometer] The microcontroller needs to be capable of measuring acceleration on three axes through an IMU or accelerator, either onboard or via a shield.
\item[Bluetooth] The microcontroller needs to be capable of connecting over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection, either onboard or via a shield.
\item[Battery] 
\end{description}

For my implementation, I used an \textbf{Arduino 101} board, which contains an Intel Curie module. It has the following specifications:\cite{dsref0}

\begin{description}
\item[Processor] 32MHz
\item[Memory] 24KB SRAM
\item[Storage] 196KB Flash memory
\item[Accelerometer] 6-axis IMU
\item[Bluetooth] Integrated BLE 
\item[Battery] A standard 9V battery
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Linux Computer}

The requirements of the computer are not onerous, and most of them are standard on just about all modern computers:

\begin{description}
\item[Processor] In order to train the network effectively, a faster processor than that of the microcontroller is necessary. 
\item[Memory] Likewise, the computer will need enough memory to hold the network. For any network which can be fitted onto the Flash (or other) memory of a microcontroller, this is unlikely to be a problem.
\item[USB Ports] At least one USB port is necessary to upload files to the microcontroller.
\item[Linux] I haven't tested any of the software on other operating systems, so a machine running a Linux variant is probably necessary.
\item[Software] A list of the necessary software can be found in the \todo{Project Management section (link)}
\end{description}

My machine, a 2013 Lenovo IdeaPad running Ubuntu 16.04, fulfills all of the above requirements.

\subsubsection{Android Phone}

Bluetooth Low Energy support was added in Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean MR2), with the Level 18 API.\cite{dsref1} Any phone running Android 4.3 or later, and which supports Bluetooth Low Energy, will suffice for this project.

My phone is a 2015 Huawei Nexus 6, running Android 7.1.2 (Nougat).

\todo[inline]{Data capture and *format specification*. Talk about Curie's IMU, and how to turn the stream of inputs into the desired format for the Neural network}

\subsubsection{Log File Specification (Supervised)}

A supervised log file will be a \lstinline{.txt} file, and generally be called \lstinline{set}, followed by a numerical suffix, for example \lstinline{set3.txt}. It is recommended that log files be stored in folders such that it is obvious whose exercises have been recorded.

The format of the file will be as follows; zero or more instances of \emph{repetitions}, each consisting of:

\begin{itemize}
\item One or more lines with the values of the inputs.
\item A line with the text \lstinline{Repetition Start}
\item One or more lines with the values of the inputs.
\item A line with the text \lstinline{Repetition End}
\item One or more lines with the values of the outputs, one line per output node
\item One or more lines with the values of the inputs.
\end{itemize}

An example of a valid supervised log file can be found \todo[inline]{todo: link}

\subsubsection{Log File Specification (Unsupervised)}

An unsupervised log file will be a \lstinline{.txt} file, and generally be called \lstinline{set}, followed by a numerical suffix, for example \lstinline{set3.txt}. It is recommended that log files be stored in folders such that it is obvious whose exercises have been recorded.

The format of the file will be as follows; zero or more instances of \emph{repetitions}, each consisting of:

\begin{itemize}
\item A line with the text \lstinline{Motion detected after X milliseconds. Logging...}
\item One or more lines with the values of the inputs.
\item A line with the text \lstinline{Motion ended after Y milliseconds. Logging...}
\end{itemize}

Where X and Y are the intervals between the last motion detection event.

Prior to normalisation, the correct targets will need to be manually added to the log file.

An example of a valid unsupervised log file can be found \todo[inline]{todo: link}

\subsubsection{Normalised Log File Specification}

A normalised log file will be a \lstinline{.txt} file, and have the name of the set from which it was normalised, followed by the suffix \lstinline{_normalised}. For example, the normalised log file for the (raw) log file \lstinline{set1.txt} would be \lstinline{set1_normalised.txt}.

The format of the file will be as follows; zero or more instances of \emph{repetitions}, each consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
\item A line with the text \lstinline{Repetition Start}
\item One or more lines with the values of the inputs, with one line/value per input node. Each value will be equal to the \textbf{sum} of the raw input values
\item A line with the text \lstinline{Repetition End}
\item One or more lines with the values of the targets, with one line/value per output node.
\end{itemize}

There should be no blank lines between repetitions.

\section{Project Plan and Management}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section briefly details how I managed my project, and the tools and methodologies that I employed. 

\todo[inline]{expand. Written largely without evaluation}

\subsection{Timetable}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Because the focus of my project changed significantly between the submission of my interim report and the submission of this report, my initial project timetable (as recorded in my interim report) is different to my revised project timetable. The revised project timetable is detailed below, while the initial timetable can be found in the appendices.\todo[inline]{Add initial timetable to appendices and link}

Because the revised timetable was only drawn up after the interim report, it contains no entries before March.

My timetable is organised by 'milestones' - each consisting of a set piece of implementation with a projected date for completion.

\subsubsection{End of research/start of implementation - 4/4/17}

Finish research so as to be ready to start implementation on time.

\subsubsection{Implementation of logging functionality - 14/4/17}

Finish implementation of a logging program to record example data and store it on computer in preparation for training.\todo[inline]{See relevant section and link}

Finishing this functionality early will enable data collection to continue alongside development, so that when I am ready to start training I will have a large enough data set to do so.

\subsubsection{Implementation of C++ neural network library - 28/4/17}

Reimplement ArduinoANN as a C++ library (see \todo[inline]{link to design section}). Additionally, implement a program to train an example of a network on the training data already connected, and do so.

\subsubsection{Implementation of classifier - 5/5/17}

Using the previously implemented neural network library, implement a classifier that runs on the Arduino and sends it's classifications back to the computer over Serial for display.

\subsubsection{Implementation of BLE functionality - 19/5/17}

Extend the classifier to send results over a BLE connection to a phone. Implement a program that runs on the phone and displays classifications sent over BLE from the Arduino.

\subsubsection{Implementation of multiple Curie networking (extension)- 2/6/17}

Train multiple networks to enable classification together, and adapt the classifier as necessary.
Extend the phone program to accept multiple BLE connections and display the results.

This milestone also acts as a buffer, giving an extra two weeks if the core implementation overruns without eating into the time to write the report.

\subsubsection{Report submission - 19/6/17}

Write the project report, and evaluate the classifier performance. 

\subsubsection{Presentation - 26/6/17}

Prepare for the project presentation, fixing bugs as necessary to make a demonstration work. 

\subsubsection{Project archive submission - 3/7/17}

Tidy up codebase and write user guide. Fix any remaining bugs and make programs more robust.

\subsection{Version Control}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{git}

I chose git\cite{ppref0} for my version control system, largely because of my prior experience with it. Within git, I used a variation of a standard workflow known as \textit{gitflow}.\cite{ppref1} 

I kept the convention of having separate \lstinline{master} and \lstinline{development} branches, but did not use release branches. 

In addition to these two branches, and the feature branches, I used two more long term branches:

The branch \lstinline{data} was created once the logging functionality was complete, and was used to track changes to the loggers and to track the recording of data. This branch was then merged to \lstinline{development} whenever necessary to make the data available for other branches.

The branch \lstinline{documentation} was created at the very start, and contains only documentation, in particular the project diary (\todo[inline]{link}) and both reports. While the projects were both written in Overleaf\todo[inline]{link}, the changes were transferred to the branch regularly.

\subsubsection{Github}

Much like git, I chose to use Github\cite{ppref2} to host my git repository largely because of my familiarity with it. 

I maintained a repository\cite{ppref3} for the duration of the project and stored virtually everything relating to my project in it.

\subsection{Languages \& Libraries Used}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The multi platform nature of this project meant that I used several languages for the various constituent parts/

\subsubsection{C++}

The core neural network code (for both the Linux and Arduino versions, see \todo[inline]{link} for details) was written in C++\cite{ppref4}. I also wrote the training and save/load code in C++.

I chose to follow the \lstinline{c++11}\cite{ppref5} standard to enable me to make use of the new \lstinline{std::vector<>} that was introduced with \lstinline{c++11}.

I used the C++ unit testing library \textit{Catch}\cite{ppref6} to write unit tests for my C++ code.

\subsubsection{Arduino}

While software for the Arduino can be written in any language which has a compiler capable of compiling a binary for the Arduino's processor, most Arduino programming is done in the Arduino C/C++ variant\cite{ppref7}, which takes file suffix \lstinline{.ino}. This variant adds some Arduino specific libraries\cite{ppref8}, but lacks many of the normal C/C++ libraries - most notably the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).\cite{ppref9}

The main Arduino programs were written in Arduino C++. I used the Intel libraries \textit{CurieIMU}\cite{ppref10} and \textit{CurieBLE}\cite{ppref11} to provide access to the Curie's IMU and BLE adapter respectively.

\subsubsection{Python}

I used Python\cite{ppref12} to write all of the necessary scripts for logging data on the computer, normalising data, and for compiling and running automated unit tests.

I used Python 2.7.12 for this project, but could have just as easily done it in Python 3.

Alongside the core Python modules \textit{sys, serial, os, subprocess} and \textit{random}, I made use of the \textit{curses}\cite{ppref13} module for terminal control.

\subsubsection{Java (Android)}

Android\cite{ppref14} programs are written in Java, which is then compiled for the Android Runtime (ART)\cite{ppref15}, instead of normal Java bytecode.

I wrote the Android phone programs to display data in Java.

\subsection{Tools Used}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{GCC}

All versions of the Gnu Compiler Collection (GCC) since GCC 4.8.1 have supported the C++11 standard\cite{ppref16}. I chose to use version 6.3.0\cite{ppref17} to compile all C++ code that runs on my computer.

\subsubsection{AVR-GCC}

To compile C/C++ code for the Arduino requires the AVR-GCC compiler. This comes bundled with the Arduino IDE\cite{ppref8} (see below).

All versions of the Arduino IDE since 1.6.6 have enabled C++11 by default.

\subsubsection{Arduino IDE}

Aside from allowing the user to edit code, the Arduino IDE\cite{ppref18} manages compilation and upload of programs to a connected Arduino.

I used version 1.8.2, but any version since 1.6.6 would have worked just as well.

Looking specifically at backpropagation, D.E. Rumelhart, G.E. Hinton and R.J. Williams were working on back propagation in neural networks in 1986 (see \url{https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/ift3395/lectures/backprop_old.pdf}), although much of their work was based on the earlier work of others, in particular Paul Werbos. 
The original Apple Macintosh, released in 1984, had a 7.83MHz processor and 128KB of RAM. (source: \url{http://oldcomputers.net/macintosh.html}, \textit{accessed 7/6/2017}
). For comparison, the Arduino 101 I am using runs at 32MHz, and 196KB of Flash memory, although it only has 24KB of SRAM. (source: \url{https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101}, \textit{accessed 7/6/2017}).

If devices such as smartphones are considered, the superiority in power is obvious.
