        Added Interim Report

        Added .gitignore and version controlled hooks
        Created basic branches
        Added README        
    Started research into HTM
        Numenta's HTM School and other resources

    Realised that NuPIC will not run on embedded hardware
    Abandoned NuPIC
    Spent afternoon looking for alternatives

7/4/17
    Agreed on using Arduino ANN (http://robotics.hobbizine.com/arduinoann.html)
    Successfully tested the Arduino/Curie
        Basic connection
        Running the example ANN
        IMU test
        BLE test
    Removed Numenta misc from the README

10/4/17
    Removed more references to Numenta...
    Filled in skeleton with subsections

11/4/17
    Added base directories
    Added logger (curie/src/logger/logger.ino) to segment exercises and send the IMU data to Serial.

12/4/17
    Added 'Data' folder
    Completely failed to make reading data from Serial work...

13/4/17
    Finally managed to make reading data from Serial work and piped it to a text file

14/4/17
    Wrote a Python script (.log-data) to create/append a given text file and log data from Serial to it

17/4/17
    Wrote a Python script (.normalise-data) to normalise the data from the text files created by .log-data
