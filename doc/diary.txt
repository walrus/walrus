Individual project 'diary'

19/12/16
    Picked up Curie board + USB cable
    downloaded IDE (CLion) - NEED TO GET LICENCE
    Downloaded A,M and Z trees

28/1/17
    Downloaded Arduino IDE
    Licenced CLion
    Connected arduino to computer and checked that I could push code to it.
        Followed this tutorial: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/fun-with-the-arduino-101-genuino-101
        And this one: http://www.arduino.org/learning/getting-started/arduino-ide-on-linux-based-os

10/2/17
    Submitted Interim Report

28/2/17
    Met with Dr Heinis
    Decided to switch to Numenta (see email)

6/3/17
    Met with Dr Deisenroth
    He seemed happy with everything; we discussed potential issues

4/4/17
    Began work in earnest
    Downloaded Numenta NuPic (https://github.com/numenta/nupic)
        Dependencies etc
    (Accidentally CHOWNed /usr/ and spent the rest of the day fixing stuff)

5/4/17
    Set up git repo at https://github.com/speedyfrenchy/project
        Added Interim Report
        Added skeleton Final Report
        Added .gitignore and version controlled hooks
        Created basic branches
        Added README        
    Started research into HTM
        Numenta's HTM School and other resources

6/4/17
    Realised that NuPIC will not run on embedded hardware
    Abandoned NuPIC
    Spent afternoon looking for alternatives

7/4/17
    Agreed on using Arduino ANN (http://robotics.hobbizine.com/arduinoann.html)
    Successfully tested the Arduino/Curie
        Basic connection
        Running the example ANN
        IMU test
        BLE test
    Removed Numenta misc from the README

10/4/17
    Removed more references to Numenta...
    Filled in skeleton with subsections

11/4/17
    Added base directories
    Added logger (curie/src/logger/logger.ino) to segment exercises and send the IMU data to Serial.

12/4/17
    Added 'Data' folder
    Completely failed to make reading data from Serial work...

13/4/17
    Finally managed to make reading data from Serial work and piped it to a text file

14/4/17
    Wrote a Python script (.log-data) to create/append a given text file and log data from Serial to it

17/4/17
    Wrote a Python script (.normalise-data) to normalise the data from the text files created by .log-data

18/4/17
    Began conversion of ArduinoANN into an actual C++ library

19/4/17
    Finished implementing ArduinoANN as a C++ library. 
    Implementation as of today should have all the functionality of ArduinoANN (subject to testing).

20/4/17
    No progress today.

21/4/17
    Choose Catch as C++ testing library
    Install Catch and set up core tests
    Write script (network/.run-tests) to compile and run tests
    Add test runner to pre-commit hook

24/4/17
    Refactor library to use vectors everywhere instead of arrays
    Begin writing regression tests

25/4/17
    Finish writing regression tests
    Update scripts
    Begin writing training code

26/4/17
    Write Curie code for supervised data logging
    Write script for supervised data logging
    Update normalising script to work for supervised data too

27/4/17
    Begin writing file handling code for saving network config
    Get stuck with compiler errors

28/4/17
    Update to GCC 6
    Fix compiler errors

1/5/17
    Finish file handling code for saving network config
    Finish file handling code for loading network config
